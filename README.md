# SI507_FInal_Project
SI 507 Final Project

## Data Sorces
Data used in this project was obtained from imbd.com. Two levels of webpages were crawled and scraped. First, information in https://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=nv_mv_250 about movie names and rankings, together with the link to the movie's own webpage, was collected. Afterwards, in each movie's own webpage, information about the movie's content rating, average rating, genre, actors, and directors, was collected. 

## Running the Program
First, it takes some time for the program to initialize itself. Please be patient. Reading the cache file and generating tables in the database could take some time. 

After the program is initialized, the user will be asked to write command in the interactive prompt. While running the program for the first time, please type "help" to see the available plotting command options. There are four plotting commands. The instructions are also available in the *help.txt* file
