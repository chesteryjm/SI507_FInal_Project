SI 507 Final Project

## Data Sorces
Data used in this project was obtained from imbd.com. Two levels of webpages were crawled and scraped. First, information in https://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=nv_mv_250 about movie names and rankings, together with the link to the movie's own webpage, was collected. Afterwards, in each movie's own webpage, information about the movie's content rating, average rating, genre, actors, and directors, was collected.
